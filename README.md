**Stroke prediction: How does Gaussian Naive Bayes perform compared to a Decision tree?**

This repository represents a term project for machine learning that aims to predict strokes from a variety of major risk factors.
It uses a dataset from Kaggle, publicly available at: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset>

The report file in this repository explains everything else. The main goal was to predict strokes based on 10 well-researched risk factors with high accuracy,
to overview how the two algorithms work "under the hood", and finally, to use common machine learning metrics (such as the ROC curve) to compare the performance of the two algorithms.



This project was completed in May of 2021, by myself, Mahir Morar, JeMarra Rivers, Colin Liu, and Chase Dannen.
